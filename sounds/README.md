## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Copyright**: Only use royalty-free or Creative Commons audio
2. **File Size**: Keep files under 1MB each for fast loading
3. **Testing**: Verify audio works across different browsers
4. **Fallback**: Game works without audio files (they'll simply not play)

## üéÆ Implementation

Audio files are automatically loaded by the HTML pages:
```html
<audio src="../sounds/filename.mp3" autoplay loop volume="0.4"></audio>
```

The game will continue to function even if audio files are missing - they simply won't play.
